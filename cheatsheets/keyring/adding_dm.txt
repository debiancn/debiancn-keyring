Adding a DM key
===============

- Request must be signed by somebody in the DM team (currently:
  anibal, enrico, xoswald). Always check it has been signed by them
  using their currently registered Debian key!

- Request must include:
  - Full DM key fingerprint
  - Agreement URL (message sent by prospective DM where he agrees with
    DFSG, SC, DMUP, and giving an overview of his current work in
    Debian) 
  - One or more DD advocates (messages signed by DDs confirming
    applicant has done Debian work and requesting him to be accepted)
  - It _may_ also include a bug number (in the regular Debian BTS)
    that should be closed when the request is dealt with. If so, close
    it in debian/changelog.

- Procedure:

  I am following the request for Javier Merino (RT #2466). Of course,
  replace keys with adequate values.

      # have signed his key, unless specific reasons
