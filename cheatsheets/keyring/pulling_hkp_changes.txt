Pulling changes from the HKP server
===================================

We run a HKP (HTTP Keyserver Protocol) keyserver to allow for public
querying on Debian keys and to allow DDs and DMs to update their keys,
i.e., sending more signatures. Updating the keyrings from this HKP
server is "pulling" HKP changes.

There's a script call pull-updates that takes a keyring and a keyring
dir, explodes the keyring and looks for keys that have changed, then
calls update-key for each of them. This is a bit of a labour intensive
task, but it does mean we don't automatically allow things like adding
a new UID that's complete nonsense. I have some local patches to make
it a bit easier in terms of automatically generating an update.log
which is the same format as in the changelog of what was altered; I'll
commit them at some point soon.

So, to import the HKP updates:

$ scp kaufmann.debian.org:/org/keyring.debian.org/pending-updates/debian-{keyring,nonupload,maintainers}.gpg .
debian-keyring.gpg        100%   30MB   2.5MB/s   00:12    
debian-maintainers.gpg	  100% 1058KB 529.1KB/s   00:02    
debian-maintainers.gpg	  100%   48KB  59.6KB/s   00:00    
$ ./scripts/pull-updates debian-keyring.gpg debian-keyring-gpg/
(...a long list of keys later...)
Updated keys are:
0x8351C3C268AC5746  0xE5273D986BE3C423  0xED1A3933B2CFCDD8
gpg: keyring `/tmp/jetring.qGSB7NPt/secring.gpg' created

Updated key.

A log of the changes is stored in updates.log:

$ cat update.log
0x8351C3C268AC5746 Robert Alan Larson <blarson>
0xE5273D986BE3C423 Paul Wise <pabs>
0xED1A3933B2CFCDD8 Philipp Kern <pkern>

So, add the following to the changelog:

  * Updates from keyring.debian.org HKP interface:
    0x8351C3C268AC5746 Robert Alan Larson <blarson>
    0xE5273D986BE3C423 Paul Wise <pabs>
    0xED1A3933B2CFCDD8 Philipp Kern <pkern>

Repeat the process for the other downloaded keyrings, and also using
the keyrings at 
kaufmann.debian.org:/org/keyring.debian.org/keyrings-new/debian-{keyring,nonupload,maintainers}.gpg
