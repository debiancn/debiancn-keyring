Git working tree
----------------

Keyring work is coordinated in the Git tree living in
/srv/keyring.debian.org/master-keyring.git/ at keyring.debian.org
(which is an alias to kaufmann.debian.org). You need to have an
account on kaufmann to get access to the working tree. The URL for the
Git repository is:

  ssh://kaufmann.debian.org/srv/keyring.debian.org/master-keyring.git/

Note that, before March 2014, we used to work on a Bazaar tree. When
the tree was imported over to Git, the only bit of lost information
were the commit signatures. The Bazaar tree up to that point (left at
commit #1297) is still available in Kaufmann, at
/srv/keyring.debian.org/master-keyring/ (probably we should replace it
to avoid confusions!).

Public tree copy
----------------

There is a public copy of the tree we push to whenever we push the
updates; it is available at Debian's Git server:

  https://alioth.debian.org/anonscm/git/keyring/keyring.git

This tree can also be browsed online at:

  http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=keyring/keyring.git

So, when you push a new revision, do:

$ git push ssh://git.debian.org/git/keyring/keyring.git master

Signing commits
---------------

All commits should be GPG-signed. To do so, specify your signing key
to Git, like:

  $ git config user.signingkey 0x0000DEAD0000BEEF

And remember to always specify the '-S' switch when committing!

Note that if you use debcommit, you can ask it to always sign commits
by either setting its DEBCOMMIT_SIGN_COMMITS configuration variable or
by specifying --sign-commit in the command line.

** Note: A nice Git hook can be of use here to remind us if we're
   missing -S

Parsing the Git changelog
-------------------------

When pushing a new keyring revision, you can use
./script/parse-git-changelog to automate several steps. Pipe it the
changelog since the last uploaded revision (remember to tag it!):

$ git log 2014.11.19.. | scripts/parse-git-changelog

It will create three files: rt-update, ldap-update and dak-update. For
the two first ones, look in the respective cheatsheets; for the
dak-update; refer to Ansgar Burchardt's message (Message-ID:
<87tx2uvcti.fsf@deep-thought.43-1.org>):

    Hi,

    as DM permissions are bound to specific keys they need to be updated if
    a DM changes his key. Currently I do so from time to time (usually when
    somebody has problems uploading packages), but it would be nice if you
    could tell dak that keys changed.
    
    To do so, please wait until the new keys have been installed and then
    upload a <user>-<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMM>.dak-commands via ftp to ftp-master. It
    should look like the following:
    
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    | Action: dm-remove
    | Fingerprint: ~bla~

    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Plus a GPG cleartext signature around everything.
    
    The Uploader and Cc fields are optional; if Uploader is not given email
    replies are sent to the primary UID of the key that was used to sign the
    file. Whitespace in fields with fingerprints is ignored to make life
    easier. The Reason field is optional and just for informational use.
    
    Would it be possible for you to do this?
